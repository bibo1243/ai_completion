# Advanced View Filtering

This workflow describes how to use the tag-based filtering system implemented in the application.

## Overview

You can now apply custom tag filters to specific views (Focus, Inspiration/Waiting, Journal, Prompt). This allows you to see only tasks relevant to specific contexts within those views.

## How to Configure Filters

1.  **Hover** over a sidebar navigation item (e.g., "Focus", "Inspiration").
2.  Press and hold the **Alt** (Option) key.
3.  A **Settings (Gear)** icon will appear next to the item name.
4.  Click the gear icon to open the **Filter Configuration Modal**.
5.  Select the tags you want to filter by.
6.  Click "Save".

## Visual Indicators

*   **Active Filter Dot**: A small colored dot will appear next to the view name in the sidebar if a filter is currently active.
*   **Filtered Content**: The view will only display tasks that match the selected tags.

## Supported Views

*   **Focus**: Filters the "Unscheduled" list (Inbox tasks) and the Calendar view.
*   **Inspiration (Waiting)**: Filters tasks in the Waiting list. Note: By default, this view shows tasks with status 'waiting' OR tag 'Inspiration'. Adding a filter restricts this set.
*   **Journal**: Filters the Journal/Album view. Note: Default behavior shows 'Album' tag. Adding a filter overrides this to show selected tags.
*   **Prompt**: Filters the Prompt view.

## Editing Modes

*   **Reorganization Mode**: In Focus view, when selecting tasks in the calendar (via Shift+Click or Command+Click), a purple "Rescheduling Mode" banner appears, indicating you can click a date to move the selected tasks.
